# 💬 WhatsApp ChatBot Automation with OpenAI

This project is a Python-based automation bot that reads WhatsApp messages from the screen, analyzes the latest message, and responds using OpenAI's GPT model. It simulates human interaction on WhatsApp desktop using `pyautogui` and `pyperclip`.

## 🔧 Features

- Automatically selects and copies chat text from a WhatsApp window.
- Uses OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model to generate responses.
- Detects if the last message was from a specific sender (e.g., "Omkar Chavan").
- Replies in Hindi (transliterated into English) like a character named "Jay" who is multilingual.
- Automates mouse clicks, selection, clipboard handling, and text input.

## 🧩 Files Description

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `01_cusor.py` | Tool to monitor and print mouse coordinates (for automation positioning). |
| `02_bot.py` | Main automation script that reads chats and responds via OpenAI. |
| `03_openai.py` | Test script to verify OpenAI response logic independently. |
| `packages.txt` | Required Python packages list. |
| `.gitattributes` | Git configuration for handling text file formats. |

## 📦 Requirements

Install dependencies listed in `packages.txt`:

```bash
pip install pyautogui pyperclip openai
````

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Ensure WhatsApp Desktop is open and positioned consistently.
2. Run `01_cusor.py` to determine pixel coordinates for your screen setup.
3. Update coordinates in `02_bot.py` if needed.
4. Set your OpenAI API key in `02_bot.py` or through environment variables.
5. Run the bot:

```bash
python 02_bot.py
```

## 🔐 Security Warning

⚠️ **Never expose your OpenAI API key publicly.** Store it securely using environment variables or external config files.

## 📌 Notes

* The bot assumes specific screen resolutions and positions for automation.
* Designed for educational/demo purposes.
* You must manually adjust the pixel values to match your WhatsApp window layout.
